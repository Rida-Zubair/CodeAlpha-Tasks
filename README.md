# CodeAlpha-Tasks
WX To-Do List Application (Code Alpha Internship Project)

## Description:
This C++ desktop application, developed as part of my internship at Code Alpha, provides a user-friendly interface for managing your to-do list using the WXWidgets library. It allows you to add, sort, delete, and save your tasks for persistent storage using file handling.

## Features:
- Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- Sort Tasks: Sort your tasks according to your needs (e.g., by priority, creation date).
- Delete Tasks: Remove individual tasks from the list.
- Delete All Tasks: Clear all tasks at once.
- Persistent Storage: The application saves your tasks to a file, allowing you to retrieve them upon reopening the program.

## Technologies:
Programming Language: C++
GUI Library: WXWidgets

## Prerequisites:
A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
WXWidgets development environment (installation instructions vary depending on your operating system)

## Installation:
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Rida-Zubair/CodeAlpha-Tasks.git
Follow the installation instructions for WXWidgets on your system.
Install any additional libraries required by the project.

## Building:
Compile the project using your C++ compiler and the WXWidgets libraries. Refer to the specific build instructions within the code (look for Code Alpha build instructions).

## Usage:
Run the compiled executable file.
Add, sort, delete, and manage your tasks through the provided GUI interface.

## Saving and Loading:
The application automatically saves tasks to a file upon closing and loads them from the same file upon opening.
You may find code comments or configuration settings within the project that allow you to customize the storage file path.
